# My Portfolio

This is a showcase of my work from the Bloc Design Program.

This is a rough first draft of a portfolio site.  It was made using HTML5 and CSS3, and it uses elements of Material Design.

It also uses stock images and placeholder content... a new portfolio should be coming by 7/1/19.  Thanks!

Here is a [link](https://hlipper.github.io/) to the live site.
